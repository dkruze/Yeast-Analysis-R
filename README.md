# Notes for Yeast Analysis
This repository consists of one script file with two PDFs that detail basic R data manipulation using libraries, as well as some more advanced data modeling techniques
using more advanced libraries. Note that all of these were written using scripts in the RStudio IDE for R version 4.2, and that instructions for script output (for when
that is relevant) are included in comments within the source code. The data being used is sourced in both of the PDFs that breakdwon the data and its motivations, but
for convenience it will also be listed here:
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast
  
The data will also be incuded in CSV format for download from this repository. These data models were built as part of the CSCI48900 Data Science & Machine Learning 
course for IUPUI.
